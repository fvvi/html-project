                    <p>Lusíada University  2006 - 2011</p>
                         <p>I embarked on my academic journey in Architecture but redirected my path after a year into the world of Industrial Design. This decision not only honed my creativity but also taught me to think beyond conventional boundaries.

                            </ul>
                             My journey in Industrial Design has been instrumental in nurturing my creative problem-solving skills, which I continue to apply across various aspects of my career.</p>
